**Dictionaries**
In python the dictionaries are key/value pairs, unlike the list the dictionaries were accessible via keys i.e. they are not accessed by position.
- Mappings in Python
- Different in sequences (do not maintain order)
- { } are used for creation of dictionaries

**Tuples**
The Tuples are used in place of lists, if the immutability is required. Example could be dates of calender.
- Similar to list
- Immutable (values cannot be re-assigned)
- Tuple objects does not support item assignment
- ( ) Parenthesis are used instead of [ ] in list
